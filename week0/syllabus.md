# Daily breakdown

Every day will start with check-in at 9:30am and check-out at 3:00pm.

Monday-Thursday mornings of the first nine weeks will generally consist of guided learning in the morning (kind of like lecture, but way more interactive), and lab time in the afternoon. During lab time, you will be working on homework assignments with the rest of your cohort, with access to instructors.

Fridays will be project days, with the entire day devoted to working on projects.

During the last three weeks, the schedule will change to accommodate working on final projects, which will be group-based.

# Grading Policy

Class is from 9:30am-3:15pm Monday-Friday, with the exception of holidays. You are expected to be on campus every day for the entire time except an hour break for lunch from 12pm-1pm. Some days there will be career-focused guest lectures during the lunch hour, which you will be told about ahead of time so you may bring a lunch.

If you attend less than 90% of classes, you will need to make up the time in some other way. The TA will have more information for you if that's the case.

In order to pass the course, you must receive a grade of 70% or higher averaged over all the assignments. You must also complete every assignment - any assignments considered **incomplete** must be resubmitted before the end of the course. Finally, you must receive a grade of 70% or higher on the final project.

## Homework Assignments

Homework assignments are self-graded, with students marking each assignment in one of four categories. These categories map to a certain number of points out of 5 possible points for each homework assignment, as outlined below:

**Incomplete**: 0/5
**Not Yet**: 3.5/5
**Meets Requirements**: 4.25/5
**Outstanding**: 5/5

You must submit your assignments when they are due, whether or not they are complete or you feel 100% confident in your work. Homework assignments will act primarily as indicators of how you are currently feeling in the moment.

## Projects

Projects are graded by WCCI staff. Projects are typically worth 100 points. 90 points of each project will be determined by the tasks that are completed, with attempts resulting in partial credit for a given task. The final 10 points of each project are determined by overall code quality, including code readability, proper variable names, and comments when necessary.

Projects must be turned in by the date and time specified on the project information page, or else they will receive a late penalty. 10% of the score will be deducted for each day that the project is late, up until 5 days. After 5 days, the project should still be submitted in order to get credit for project completion per course requirements.

## Final Projects

Final projects will be worth 100 points per week worked on the project, with each week graded independently. These grades will be determined based upon the milestones set for each project and how well those milestones were met.
